## Configuration / Environment Variables (`.env`)

You'll need to create a `.env` file in both the `backend` and `infostore-frontend` directories  (if applicable, values may be different in each).  Here are some of the environment variables likely needed:

**Backend (.env):**

* `DATABASE_URL`: Your MongoDB connection string.
* `JWT_SECRET`:  A secret key for JWT authentication.
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID.
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key.
* `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your S3 bucket.
* `EMAIL_USER`: Your email address for sending notifications.
* `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your email password (Consider using a dedicated email service for security).


**Frontend (.env):**  (Likely only needs backend API URL)

* `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The base URL of your backend API.
